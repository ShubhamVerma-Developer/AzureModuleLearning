# What is Azure Static Web Apps?

Azure Static Web Apps solves the hard problems all the way from your source code to global availability.

While you stay focused on developing your app, Azure Static Web Apps automatically builds and hosts it from GitHub or Azure DevOps.

Static web apps are commonly built using libraries and frameworks like Angular, React, Svelte, or Vue. These apps include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets that make up the application. When using a traditional web server architecture, these files are served from a single server along side any required API endpoints.

With Azure Static Web Apps, static assets are separated from a traditional web server and are instead served from points globally distributed around the world. This distribution makes serving files much faster as files are physically closer to users. API endpoints, which are optional, are hosted using a serverless architecture, which avoids the need for a full back-end server altogether.
