Azure Storage provides various services to meet different data storage and management needs. Here's an overview of the main Azure Storage services:

## Azure Blob Storage:

Overview: Blob Storage is designed for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as documents, images, videos, and logs.
Use Cases: Content delivery, backups, data archiving, media storage.
Key Features: Supports hot, cool, and archive storage tiers, hierarchical namespace, and versioning.

## Azure File Storage:

Overview: Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud, accessible via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
Use Cases: File sharing, application data sharing, and cloud-based file servers.
Key Features: Fully managed, supports SMB and REST APIs, can be mounted on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Azure Table Storage:

Overview: A NoSQL data store that provides key/attribute storage with a schema-less design, suitable for semi-structured data.
Use Cases: Scalable applications, quick and flexible data storage.
Key Features: NoSQL, automatic indexing, low-latency access to large amounts of data.

## Azure Queue Storage:

Overview: A simple message-queue service that enables communication between components of cloud services.
Use Cases: Decoupling of application components, workload scaling.
Key Features: Message queuing, reliable and asynchronous communication.

## Azure Disk Storage:

Overview: Managed disks provide scalable and high-performance block storage for Azure Virtual Machines.
Use Cases: Virtual machine storage, database storage.
