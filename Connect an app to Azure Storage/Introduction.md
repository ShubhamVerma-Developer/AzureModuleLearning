# Connect an app to Azure Storage

To connect an application to Azure Storage, you'll typically need to follow these general steps. The specific implementation details may vary based on the programming language and framework used in your application.

## Prerequisites:

### Azure Storage Account:

Ensure you have an Azure Storage account created. If not, refer to the previous instructions on how to create an Azure Storage account.

### Access Keys or Shared Access Signature (SAS):

Retrieve the access keys or generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token for your Azure Storage account. These credentials will be used by your application to authenticate and access the storage account.
