# Choose your account settings

The storage account settings we've already covered apply to the data services in the account. Here, we discuss the three settings that apply to the account itself, rather than to the data stored in the account:

- Name
- Deployment model
- Account kind
  These settings affect how you manage your account and the cost of the services within it.
