# Natural language processing (NLP)

NLP enables you to create software that can:

Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.
For example, Starship Commander is a virtual reality (VR) game from Human Interact that takes place in a science fiction world. The game uses natural language processing to enable players to control the narrative and interact with in-game characters and starship systems.
