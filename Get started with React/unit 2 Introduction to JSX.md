# Introduction to JSX

React uses a special syntax known as JavaScript XML (JSX). JSX allows you to integrate both HTML (or custom components you might create) and JavaScript into a single file or even single line of code. By using JSX, you can rely on JavaScript syntax for logic. Visual Studio Code provides IntelliSense for JSX files, so it's a useful tool when you're working with React.
