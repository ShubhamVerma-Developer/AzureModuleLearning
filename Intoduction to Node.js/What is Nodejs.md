# What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute server-side JavaScript code. It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser.

Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, providing a unified language and environment for building web applications. It is particularly well-suited for building scalable and high-performance network applications, as it is event-driven and non-blocking.
