# Introduction

Azure Files is a cloud-based file storage service provided by Microsoft Azure. It enables you to set up highly available network file shares in the cloud that can be accessed using the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This allows you to migrate and run existing applications in the cloud without the need for significant modifications.

Key features of Azure Files:

- Fully Managed Service: Azure Files is a fully managed service, which means Microsoft takes care of the underlying infrastructure, including maintenance, updates, and monitoring.

- SMB Protocol Support: Azure Files supports the SMB protocol, making it compatible with both Windows and Linux environments. This makes it easy to integrate with existing applications and systems.

- Scalability: Azure Files provides scalable storage that can be easily adjusted based on your requirements. You can increase or decrease the storage capacity without affecting your applications.

- Redundancy and High Availability: Azure Files automatically replicates your data within the same region to ensure high availability and durability. You can also enable cross-region replication for additional redundancy.

- Access Control: Azure Files supports Azure Active Directory integration, allowing you to manage access to your file shares using Azure AD identities. This helps enhance security and control over your data.

- Integration with Azure Services: Azure Files seamlessly integrates with other Azure services, such as Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Functions, making it easier to build end-to-end solutions.

- File Sync: Azure File Sync enables you to synchronize on-premises file servers with Azure Files, allowing you to centralize file services in the cloud while maintaining local access to files.

- REST API and PowerShell Support: Azure Files provides a REST API and PowerShell commands, enabling programmatic access to manage and automate file share operations.
