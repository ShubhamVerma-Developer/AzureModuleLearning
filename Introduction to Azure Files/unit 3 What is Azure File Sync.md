Azure File Sync enables centralizing your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of a Windows file server. While some users might opt to keep a full copy of their data locally, Azure File Sync can turn Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file shares. You can use any protocol available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS. You can have as many caches as you need across the world.
