# What is version control?

A version control system (VCS) is a program or set of programs that tracks changes to a collection of files. One goal of a VCS is to easily recall earlier versions of individual files or of the entire project. Another goal is to allow several team members to work on a project, even on the same files, at the same time without affecting each other's work.
