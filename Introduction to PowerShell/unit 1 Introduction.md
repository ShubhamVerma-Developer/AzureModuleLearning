# Introduction

PowerShell is a command-line shell and a scripting language all in one. It was designed as a task engine that uses cmdlets to wrap tasks that people need to do. In PowerShell, you can run commands on local or remote machines. You can do tasks like managing users and automating workflows.

Whether you're part of an operations team or a development team that's adopting DevOps principles, PowerShell can help. You can use it to address various tasks, such as managing cloud resources and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). PowerShell offers many helpful commands, but you can expand its capabilities at any time by installing modules.
