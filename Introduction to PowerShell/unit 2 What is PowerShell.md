# What is PowerShell?

PowerShell consists of two parts: a command-line shell and a scripting language. It started out as a framework to automate administrative tasks in Windows. PowerShell has grown into a cross-platform tool that's used for many kinds of tasks.

A command-line shell lacks a graphical interface, where you use a mouse to interact with graphical elements. Instead, you type text commands into a computer console. Here are some of the benefits of using a console:

- Interacting with a console is often faster than using a graphical interface.
- In a console, you can run batches of commands, so it's ideal for task automation for continuous-integration pipelines.
- You can use a console to interact with cloud resources and other resources.
- You can store commands and scripts in a text file and use a source-control system. This capability is probably one of the biggest benefits, because your commands are repeatable and auditable. In many systems, especially government systems, everything must be traced and evaluated, or audited.
  Audits cover everything from database changes to changes done by a script.
