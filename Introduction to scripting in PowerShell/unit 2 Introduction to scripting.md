PowerShell scripting is the process of writing a set of statements in the PowerShell language and storing those statements in a text file. Why would you do that? After you use PowerShell for a while, you find yourself repeating certain tasks, like producing log reports or managing users. When you've repeated something frequently, it's probably a good idea to automate it: to store it in such a way that makes it easy to reuse.
