# Translate text and speech with Azure AI services

## Text and speech translation

Text translation can be used to translate documents from one language to another, translate email communications that come from foreign governments, and even provide the ability to translate web pages on the Internet. Many times you will see a Translate option for posts on social media sites, or the Bing search engine can offer to translate entire web pages that are returned in search results.

Speech translation is used to translate between spoken languages, sometimes directly (speech-to-speech translation) and sometimes by translating to an intermediary text format (speech-to-text translation).
